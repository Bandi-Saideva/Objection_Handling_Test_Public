107,"Hi David, Apologies for the delayed responses.  After a review of different providers, we have decided to go with Salesloft.  I prefer to be transparent...my decision was down to a few reasons such as the team prefered the Salesloft interface plus two of the newbies have used Salesloft before.  As mentioned we are also commencing a relationship with an external SDR agency and they use Salesloft across all their 50+ teams and this meant we could tie our internal and external teams together more easily. Lastly their contact also had a personal connection to Turtl, in London, which also gave them an advantage.  I want to thank you for your time and effort in helping us evaluate Outplay - really appreciate your efforts. I'll be in touch if anything changes. Thanks, Josh

109,"Hi David, 
 
 Just had a sync with my CTO, gave him the quick and dirty. He’s very interested (along with our sales team as Outplay seems to check all of their combined boxes), and even more interested when I told him what I told you that we have Chili
 Piper and thinking we needed links for each sales rep (and then some) but we may be able to have some savings if the meeting booking tool Outplay has built-in works for the bulk of our booking tool needs, we still may need a couple Chili Piper licenses, but
 definitely saving money if everyone with an Outplay license just uses their booker included! 
 
 I booked time @ 2:45pm ET on Monday, we both have availabilities in the morning if you happen to, I just noticed you were booked out from 9am-2:30pm. Either way, 245pm at the latest works for us and we look forward to syncing with you then.
 Thanks!!

 Concerning your request… 
 
 
 I am not the correct person to reach out to about this topic at Datamyte.  I have no influence or responsibility in selecting sales tools for the sales team. We do not use Salesloft, and rather use Sales Force and Zoom Info, so your information on our company is apparently incorrect or outdated. Unfortunately, our internal corporate policy does not allow me to provide you with names or contact information for other employees at Datamyte, so I am unable to help you with your
 request for this information. The names and titles of our corporate management team are listed on our company website.  You could start there to get the names and titles and then try to do research on the web to
 find contact information for those people. We have invested a lot of money in Sales Force and Zoom Info over the past 5 years, so I do not believe the chances of success for selling any products that compete with or replace
 these products will be very high at this time.   
 
 Hope that helps.  Best regards,

After putting the filters of India, Industry as Retail, and revenue of 200m+, only three companies popped up(Bombay Dyeing, SSIPL Retail, REI Agro). Vivek this is the exact reason why our users leverage the proxy of employee size instead of revenue to target companies of their interest - since metrics like Revenue, EBIDTA, etc are easily available for public companies and not so much for private companies.  I hope I was able to provide some more clarity in our coverage of Retail as an industry on the platform.

 Please accept my apologies, unfortunately a prospect facing meeting ran over and I was unable to notify you. 
 
Although I wasn’t able to attend our call this afternoon to give you the news personally, we have now created a final shortlist of providers and unfortunately on this occasion we will not be moving forward with Outplay. 
 
 Whilst the core feature set of Outplay is broadly in line with our requirements, I feel that the functionality and integration capabilities out Salesloft
 and Outreach are a better fit for us at this time. 
 
I would however like to personally thank you for your patience, knowledge and professionalism through our conversations and wish you and the team at Outplay every success moving forward. 
 
 Naturally, should anything change, I won’t hesitate to get in touch.

 Thanks for your continued outreach to me. I hope you and your team are staying healthy during these difficult times.

 the budget for many solutions in normal times, much less during these COVID-19 circumstances.

 Hey Nigel, 
 
 
 
 
 I'm trying to figure out who to speak with about the sales development team. Can you point me in the right direction? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I'm reaching out because I see that the sales team uses Salesloft. Would it make sense to jump on a short call to talk about the differences between   Outplay   vs
 Salesloft? 
 
 
 
 
 - 50% of the cost of Salesloft 
 
 - Instant chat support, 24/7 
 
 - Monthly license, you can start with 1 seat 
 
 - Built in native text messaging 
 
 
 
 
 Let me know what your calendar is like in the next few days to explore if Outplay is a good option for you.

 Ah, I understand. There is no way to do monthly without a yearly commitment I assume?
 
 
 Personally I don’t mind, but I’m trying to get this approved really quick internally and that might be a small roadblock.
 
 
 Spreading the $1500 on 12 months with the commitment might do it though.

 Nice message. (That`s a rarity, sadly).

 I had a good call with Muneesh Tyagi.   
 Since my Mastermind group has 70+ members that use Email Marketing, Automation, LinkedIn, Chat and Calling – I thought that they would benefit from OutPlay. 
 I proposed to Muneesh that I would sign up for the 14 day trial and then will be able to speak intelligently about its features to my Mastermind group. 
 And maybe then, you or someone from OutPlay can do a short webinar next month – in May. 
 Thanks for your feedback.

588,"Hi David, 
 
 We use the Enhanced Email feature in Salesforce (Image 1 below). This is in tandem with the Salesforce plugin for Outlook. If they are sending emails through Outplay, does it know we use Enhanced Email? In other words, will both an EmailMessage
 record  and  completed Task be created or just a completed Task? 
 
 I ask because Enhanced Email gives us an API and a number of essential features we don’t get by using the outdated solution of logging completed Tasks for sent emails. 
 
 Aside from the ones mentioned in the image, these features include: 
 
 The date and time (not just date) that the email was sent, allowing the Activity Timeline to order the EmailMessage records (see Image 2 below). Tasks show out-of-order, making it
 difficult to track the chain of events. The sender and recipient are visible on the Activity Timeline. Also, the sender is not reliant on being the Task Owner, so changing the owner does not obscure the sender. Engagement metrics, such as when the email was opened and how many time is was viewed. I understand this is available in Outplay, but we should have this data in Salesforce too (as
 we currently do). Tasks are editable but EmailMessage records are not, thereby preserving the content and metadata of the email as it was originally sent. 
 
 Not to mention the API which allows us to hit the EmailMessage object and pull up emails in Salesforce using SOQL queries.

 Thank you for contacting the office regarding your Outplay. I noticed you addressed Dr. Badia as Alejandro. Just a friendly reminder that he is an upper extremity orthopedic subspecialist and it is more appropriate
 to refer to him as Dr. Badia, “unless of course, you are a personal friend”. I will forward your email to the proper party who will handle your request and they will reach out to you if interested.
 
 
 While I have your attention, I would like to make you aware that Dr. Badia has released a best seller,

 The goal of the book is to inform and make the public aware that a large part of US healthcare problems, both cost and access issues, due to complex barriers that exist within the system today. These CAN be broken
 down if we simply educate the public.  ‘Healthcare From The Trenches’ , is available on Kindle. 
 
 Please help further this goal by engaging in any way you see fit. Whether telling people about the book, sending the below link or sharing this powerful message on your social media platforms, particularly as

739,"Hi Laxman, I just started to watch the video as today.   Will there be an option to pull all email addresses we have in crelate i.e. Work, personal, and other email?   How do we confidently ""know"" the correct email will be used by Outplay?   EXAMPLE:  I use personal email address for recruiting candidates and work address for Business Development.  How do I determine that the correct primary 'tagged' email will be used for the contact when I assign the req to the sequence. Is the intention to pull all contact information from crelate to Outplay?  For me  - that is too much.  I have over 80k contacts in crelate.  I'd only want relevant contacts that are associated with the req and will be contacts (in the appropriate stage) to be pulled into Outplay.  I am based in Europe.  Does Outplay have a data processing agreement (DPA) for me to review per GDPR law?   I'm sure you're putting together a FAQ from your other beta's - I'd be sure to see what their questions are.

811,"Hi Laxman, 
 
We would like to reduce our license count in Outplay from 89 licences down to 12. 
 
The user admin account is: jackson@escalon.io 
 
Going forward we would only like to use Gmail accounts with Outplay.  
 
By our calculations, there are 12 gmail accounts and 72 outlook account.  
 
I believe our next payment is due today or tomorrow.  Please adjust the payment amount so we are only paying for the 12 gmail accounts at $30 per user.  
 
Therefore I only authorize a charge to our Amex on file for $360 USD vs. The full amount of $2,670 USD, effective today and going forward. 
 
We might scale up gmail accounts, but we will be using our own internal tool for outlook delivery management.  
 
Furthermore we haven’t been able to login into Outplay all day to export campaigns and data and need help running exports from your system.  If you or RAM could help with this we would appreciate it.

 I appreciate this. I think it will help us stay focused on improving. 
 
 A few questions that I’ve had: 
 
 How do we go about getting me and my team real licenses at $70/month? We’ll need 8 of them right now. My credit card info is in the system
 and you can use that if needed. Is it possible to rearrange the custom fields that I’ve created and mapped? I think I recall you saying we can click a button from the person and it will push us into LinkedIn Navigator. How do I do that? When setting the trigger for a successful call and I want that person to be pulled out of the sequence, do I choose the action of finish
 sequence to prospect or pause sequence to prospect? 
 
 Thanks,

908,"Thanks for elaborating, Laxman. 
 
 As someone who works in finance, I hear what you’re saying: to hire and retain a strong support team you need to treat them well which requires predictable cash flows. 
 
 As ironic as it may sound given my expertise, for me it’s a cash issue.
 
 
 I’ll spare you the details, but I just quit my corporate career to start my own business. I couldn’t bear the thought of working another 20 years feeling like I did. My wife did make me sleep on the couch for the first two weeks since I
 didn’t discuss it with her first (probably wouldn’t have done it then). Perhaps the worst decision of my life, we’ll see. 
 
 Paying upfront while still in the process of building my business is a show stopper, pal.
 
 
 Coming back to your question, I guess that’s answer A?

Kind regards,
