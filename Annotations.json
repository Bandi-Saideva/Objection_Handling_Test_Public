Outplay uses the perfect combination of Automation\n\n and Personalization to cut through the noise. \n \n \n \n\nI'm not sure if the timing is right, but would it make sense to jump on a short call to talk about how we do things differently at Outplay?  \n \n \n \n\nPlease let me know what your calendar is like in the next few days to explore if Outplay is a good option for you \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cheers, \n \n \n \n\nBill Stiber \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sales Growth Advisor \n \n \n 1-770-800-8817 Direct \n \n \n Outplay -  https://outplayhq.com/ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you'd like me to stop sending you emails, please  \n\nclick here \n \n \n",

We do not use Salesloft, and rather use Sales Force and Zoom Info, so your information on our company is apparently incorrect or outdated. Unfortunately, our internal corporate policy does not allow me to provide you with names or contact information for other employees at Datamyte, so I am unable to help you with your\n request for this information. The names and titles of our corporate management team are listed on our company website.  You could start there to get the names and titles and then try to do research on the web to\n find contact information for those people. We have invested a lot of money in Sales Force and Zoom Info over the past 5 years, so I do not believe the chances of success for selling any products that compete with or replace\n these products will be very high at this time.   \n \n Hope that helps.  Best regards, \n \n Jim \n \n Jim Dallos \n Regional Sales Manager \n Datamyte \n 700 Tower Drive, Suite 500 - Troy, MI  48098 - USA \n Phone: (248) 658-4659 \n Mobile: (248) 260-0309 \n E-Mail:  jim.dallos@datamyte.com",

But hey! I got\n your back. Here's the  \nrecording of the webinar.   \n \n \n \n \n \n Usually, folks who attend the webinar are chasing some high revenue goals and highly talented SDRs to get that job done quicker. \n \n \n \n \n \n Sometimes, what teams lack is, appropriate sales automation tools to ramp their new hires quicker, and enable them to hit quota within 3-4 months. We've been working closely\n with other fast-growing sales teams to automate manual activities that don't add real value to the sales process (like writing emails from scratch, looking for people's profiles on LinkedIn, creating tasks, etc.,) \n \n \n \n \n \n Is this worth exploring for your team? \n \n \n \n \n \n Scott \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Scott Ailsworth  / Sales Growth Advisor  \n \n \n P : (770) 637-3412 \n \n \n Outplay -  https://outplayhq.com \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Outplay in 2-minutes -   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbGIFcCse8A \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If you'd like me to stop sending you emails, please\n \nclick here \n \n \n",

    "new_clean_msg": "Joe,  Thank you for answering my questions.  I am on a free trial of Hubspot and I'd like to test the integration. Can you please forward directions on how to link my Hubspot account to the free trial Outplay account?  I am slightly confused about how Outplay tracks call cadence steps if there isn't a Dialpad plug in within Outplay. If I have a call step in a cadence, how will its completion be tracked?  I see that the base price for Outplay is $900/user/year.  We will need 3 licenses now and one more by the end of Q1 2022.  If you can offer me a discount of 33% ($600/user/year) on a one year contract with Outplay for up to 4 seats, we are interested in moving forward.  Please ensure the discount will be renewable for additional 1 yr contracts for at least 3 years.

Also, the sender is not reliant on being the Task Owner, so changing the owner does not obscure the sender. Engagement metrics, such as when the email was opened and how many time is was viewed.

We do our best at Outplay in this area. \n \n \n \n \n \n Our avg response time on support is under 2 minutes, we do unlimited Zoom calls to help customers, we rank 9.9 of 10 on G2 for quality of support (while the industry avg is 9), and much more to make sure our customers succeed. \n \n \n \n \n \n But, all this works well and worth our team's time and effort, only when we work with long-term use case customers vs short-term. \n \n \n \n \n \n If it's a budget issue, we offer a different workaround for customers. \n \n \n If it's a trust issue, we offer a 60-day no-questions-asked opt-out from the contract. \n \n \n \n \n \n If it's a short-term need/use case, we recommend other great products in the market. \n \n \n \n \n \n I know it's long but let me know your thoughts. \n \n \n \n \n \n On Wed, Apr 14, 2021 at 8:25 PM Sergio van Luijk < svl@svlmanagement.com > wrote: \n \n \n \n",
